## Базовые квалификации

Breaking into your first API documentation role can be challenging. Employers will usually have three requirements to hire you:

Familiarity with 1-2 programming languages or other technical foundations
Experience writing docs for a developer audience
A portfolio with writing samples demonstrating the above two points
These requirements are why I’ve focused this course on activities that will help you break into the field. Although I could create more quizzes in this course, and at the end, you could earn a “certificate” (which wouldn’t be a bad idea, actually) it would be virtually meaningless in your job search and larger goals. There’s no way around it: if you’re serious about breaking into API documentation, you need to fulfill the above requirements. Completing the activities in this course will help you do that.

In nearly every job description for technical writers in developer documentation, you’ll see requirements like this:

Ability to read code in one or more programming languages, such as Java, C++, or Python.

You may wonder what the motivation is behind these requirements, especially if the core APIs are RESTful. After all, they can’t expect you to do a programmer’s job. No, but here’s the most common scenario. The company has a REST API for interacting with their services. To make it easy for developers, the company provides SDKs and client implementations in various languages for the REST API.
